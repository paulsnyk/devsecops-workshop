## Clone the repository

Let's start by cloning a fresh copy of this public repository from GitHub.  In your working environment, run these commands to start from your home directory and perform a clone of the repository:

```bash
git clone {YOUR_REPO_URL}
cd snyk-iac-workshop
```

Snyk tests and monitors CloudFormation files from source code repositories. It gives advice on how to better secure cloud environments by catching misconfigurations before they are pushed to production along with assistance on how best to fix them

* Run the following IaC scan of any files inside the folder "**CloudFormation**". This will pick up all the IaC config files which exist in this directory in our case we have two files

```bash
$ snyk iac test ./CloudFormation/

Review the results to get an idea of the types of IaC vulnerabilities that Snyk alerts on.

The next exercise will show how to use the Snyk UI to remediate an IaC issue.
