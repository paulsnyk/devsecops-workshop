# Introduction

## Learning objectives

The primary objective of this workshop is to learn about application security, including how to find and fix application security vulnerabilities by using Snyk. You also will deploy modern, containerized applications onto AWS by using various AWS services in tandem with infrastructure as code templates.

Who should take this workshop?

* Developers
* DevOps Engineers
* Application Security Engineers
* Solution Architects
* Anyone who wants to learn more about application security!

## Workshop Structure

This workshop includes three modules. The first two modules guide you through the process of deploying intentionally vulnerable applications onto AWS, hacking into them, and finding and fixing the vulnerabilities you exploited by using Snyk. The vulnerabilities in these two modules are different from each other, as they are rooted in different layers of a modern application.

The third module will enable you to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed to customer-facing or internet-facing environments by scanning for security issues in AWS CodePipeline (CI/CD).

- Prerequisites **(15 minutes)**
- Module 1: Build, deploy, hack and fix a demo App with open source vulnerabilities  **(90 minutes)**
- Module 2: Build, deploy, hack and fix a demo App with container vulnerabilities  **(60 minutes)**
- Module 3: Deploy Snyk checks into AWS CodePipline **(30 minutes)**
- Module 4: Conclusion **(30 minutes)**
