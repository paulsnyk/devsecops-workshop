## Workshop Structure

In this workshop, we'll perform activities related to the creation and deployment cloud resources managed by Infrastructure as Code.  

We will deploy a vunerable application and will hack the application for a known vulnerability. 
Using the Snyk platform we will identify the vulnerability, fix the issue then prove the application is no longer vulnerable.
