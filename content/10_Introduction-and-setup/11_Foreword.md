# Foreword

## The problem of implementing secure application development <!-- TODO: MODIFY the body -->

The shift to cloud technologies has redefined the roles of IT, security and app teams. The app code and code dependencies are the most obvious areas of developer concern, but with the rise of DevOps thereâ€™s also a shift for the app teams to be responsible for the running state of their apps as well. 

App teams define the configuration and deployment for the app and for the cloud services and infrastructure the app requires with IaC configuration. What has traditionally been the responsibility of central IT has now shifted to application teams, who have different needs to handle application security for all the cloud services that the app requires, specifically because they are not security experts in all these domains. 

App teams need to understand and implement best practices and tools when working in this cloud native world.

## Next: The Technical Problem <!-- TODO: MODIFY the body -->
In the next section, we describe the technical hurdles to doing infrastructure without security.
