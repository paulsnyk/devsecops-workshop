## Welcome
Welcome! In this workshop you will deploy intentionally vulnerable applications onto AWS and exploit them the same way an attacker would. You will then learn how to find and fix the same vulnerabilities you exploited by using the Snyk developer security platform.

## About Snyk
Snyk is a developer-first security platform that enables developers and security teams to find and fix vulnerabilities in their first-party code, open source dependencies, container images, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC).
